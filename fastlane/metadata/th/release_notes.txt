Dash Wallet v4.0 brings with it a completely redesigned experience that seeks to enhance ease of use in an intuitive and familiar way across all your devices. We reimagined our passphrase verification process to highlight the importance of safeguarding a userâ€™s passphrase for later wallet recovery while also allowing new users to postpone doing so; for example, if the location where they installed the app is not suitable to write down their 12-word passphrase. We have also added shortcuts to the home screen for quicker access to features commonly used. Our settings menu has also been repositioned in the app and organized to help users configure their wallet faster and easier. Users now have much broader control over their security settings and the ability to decide how frequently entering their PIN is required.
